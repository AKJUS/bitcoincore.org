Disclosure of the details of a log-filling bug which allowed an attacker to cause a victim node to
fill up its disk space by repeatedly sending invalid blocks. Exploitability of this bug is limited,
as it would take a long time before it would cause the victim to run out of disk space. A fix was
released on October 10th 2025 in Bitcoin Core v30.0.

This issue is considered **Low** severity.

## Details

A node would unconditionally log when receiving a block that fails basic sanity checks, or when
receiving a block that branches off prior to the last checkpoint. By repeatedly sending such an
invalid block to a victim node, an attacker could cause the victim to run out of disk space.

This issue was fixed by implementing log rate-limiting across the board, also preventing future
issues of the same type from happening.

## Attribution

Niklas Goegge discovered this bug and disclosed it responsibly. Eugene Siegel independently
re-discovered this bug and disclosed it responsibly.

Eugene Siegel and Niklas Goegge worked on a fix mitigating all types of log-filling attacks.

Credits also to contributor "practicalswift" who previously raised concerns
about disk-filling vectors in Bitcoin Core and worked to address them.
