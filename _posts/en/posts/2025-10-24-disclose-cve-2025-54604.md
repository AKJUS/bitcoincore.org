  An attacker could cause a victim node to fill up its disk space by repeatedly faking self-connections over a long time. A fix was released on October 10th 2025 in Bitcoin Core v30.0.
---

Disclosure of the details of a log-filling bug which allowed an attacker to fill up the disk space
of a victim node by faking self-connections. Exploitability of this bug is limited, and it would
take a long time before it would cause the victim to run out of disk space.  A fix was released on
October 10th 2025 in Bitcoin Core v30.0.

This issue is considered **Low** severity.

## Details

Bitcoin Core would unconditionally log in case of self-connection. This could be exploited by an
attacker by waiting for a victim to connect to it and reusing the version message nonce to establish
many connections to the victim, causing it to detect those attempts as self-connections. However,
exploitability is limited because the initial connection from the victim will timeout after 60
seconds by default.

This issue was fixed by implementing log rate-limiting across the board, also preventing future
issues of the same type from happening.

## Attribution

Niklas Goegge discovered this bug and disclosed it responsibly.

Eugene Siegel and Niklas Goegge worked on a fix mitigating all types of log-filling attacks.

Credits also to contributor "practicalswift" who previously raised concerns
about disk-filling vectors in Bitcoin Core and worked to address them.
