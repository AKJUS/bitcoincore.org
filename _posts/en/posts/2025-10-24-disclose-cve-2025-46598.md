Disclosure of the details of a resource exhaustion issue when processing an unconfirmed transaction.
A fix was released on October 10th 2025 in Bitcoin Core v30.0.

This issue is considered **Low** severity.

## Details

An attacker could send specially-crafted unconfirmed transactions that would take a victim node a
few seconds each to validate. The non-standard transactions would be rejected but not lead to a
disconnection and the process could be repeated. This could be exploited to delay block propagation.

The issue was mitigated in multiple steps by reducing the validation time in different Script
contexts.

## Attribution

Antoine Poinsot reported this issue to the Bitcoin Core security mailing list.

Pieter Wuille, Anthony Towns and Antoine Poinsot implemented mitigations to reduce the worst case
validation time of unconfirmed transactions.
